Supply chain tracking system

A decentralized application (dApp) designed to track goods or assets across a supply chain networkâ€”from manufacturers to distributors, retailers, and end consumers. This system ensures transparency, traceability, and tamper-proof records using Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity.

<--Key Features-->

Immutable tracking records on the blockchain
Unique product IDs and metadata for each asset
Transfer of ownership between supply chain participants
Event logging (manufacture, dispatch, delivery, etc.)
Real-time asset status and history
Role-based access control (Manufacturer, Transporter, Retailer, Consumer)
